# Description
This homework focuses on implementing and using a support vector machine for classification. Additionally, using a validation set to tune parameters, specifically, the learning rate of the SVM.

Objective is to write a program to train a support vector machine on the data using stochastic gradient descent, without using a package to train the classifier (that's the point).

# Data
The UC Irvine machine learning data repository hosts a collection of data on adult income, donated by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker. You can find this data at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult For each record, there is a set of continuous attributes, and a class "less than 50K" or "greater than 50K". We have pre-split the data training with 43957 examples with known class labels, and testing data with 4885 examples without class labels. Use this data, not the original, for this assignment.
