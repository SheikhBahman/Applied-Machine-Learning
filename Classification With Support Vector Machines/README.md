# Description

The focuses on this project/assignment is to develop a python code (without using libraries) for simple naive Bayes and decision forest classifiers and then using the developed code to perform Diabetes Classification.

# Data
A famous collection of data on whether a patient has diabetes, known as the Pima Indians dataset, and originally owned by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases can be found at Kaggle. Download this dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/kumargh/pimaindiansdiabetescsv. 

# Objectives

## Part A 
Without using libraries:
- Build a simple naive Bayes classifier to classify this data set. 
- Use a normal distribution to model each of the class-conditional distributions.
- Compute an estimate of the accuracy of the classifier by averaging over 10 test-train splits. Each split should randomly assign 20% of the data to test, and the rest to train.

## Part B
Adjust the developed code in part A so that, for attribute 3 (Diastolic blood pressure), attribute 4 (Triceps skinfold thickness), attribute 6 (Body mass index), and attribute 8 (Age), it regards a value of 0 as a missing value when estimating the class-conditional distributions, and the posterior. Compute an estimate of the accuracy of the classifier by averaging over 10 test-train splits.
